Compiling the sample with optimization on (-O+) with the C Set++ V2.1
compiler (at CSD11) will expose an optimization bug.  To prevent this
problem, we have turned optimization off.  Please note that this
problem does not occur with the new release of C Set++, officially
known as VisualAge C++ for OS/2 V3.0.
